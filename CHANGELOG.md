## [0.9.0](https://github.com/python-ring-doorbell/python-ring-doorbell/tree/0.9.0) (2024-08-21)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/python-ring-doorbell/python-ring-doorbell/compare/0.8.12...0.9.0)

**Release highlights:**

- Async support for the library
- Removed python 3.8 support

**Breaking changes:**

- Synchronous api calls are now deprecated.  For example calling `Ring.update_data()` will emit a deprecation warning to use `await Ring.async_update_data()` which should be run within an event loop via `asyncio.run()`.  See `test.py` for an example.
- Calling the deprecated sync api methods from inside a running event loop is not supported.  This is unlikely to affect many consumers as the norm if running in an event loop is to make synchronous api calls from an executor thread.
- Python 3.8 is no longer officially supported and could break in future releases.

**Breaking change pull requests:**

- Drop python3.8 support and enable python3.13 in the CI [\#398](https://github.com/python-ring-doorbell/python-ring-doorbell/pull/398) (@sdb9696)

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/python-ring-doorbell/python-ring-doorbell/tree/0.6.0) (2020-01-14)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/python-ring-doorbell/python-ring-doorbell/compare/0.5.0...0.6.0)

**Major breaking change:**

Ring APIs offer 1 endpoint with all device info. 1 with all health for doorbells etc. The API used to make a request from each device to the "all device" endpoint and fetch its own data.

With the new approach we now just fetch the data once and each device will fetch that data. This significantly reduces the number of requests.

See updated [test.py](https://github.com/tchellomello/python-ring-doorbell/blob/0.6.0/test.py) on usage.

Changes:
 - Pass a user agent to the auth class to identify your project (at request from Ring)
 - For most updates, just call `ring.update_all()`. If you want health data (wifi stuff), call `device.update_health_data()` on each device
 - Renamed `device.id` -> `device.device_id`, `device.account_id` -> `device.id` to follow API naming.
 - Call `ring.update_all()` at least once before querying for devices
 - Querying devices now is a function `ring.devices()` instead of property `ring.devices`
 - Removed `ring.chimes`, `ring.doorbells`, `ring.stickup_cams`
 - Cleaned up tests with pytest fixtures
 - Run Black on code to silence hound.

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/python-ring-doorbell/python-ring-doorbell/tree/0.5.0) (2020-01-12)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/python-ring-doorbell/python-ring-doorbell/compare/0.4.0...0.5.0)

**Breaking Change:**

The `Auth` class no longer takes an `otp_callback` but now takes an `otp_code`. It raises `MissingTokenError` if `otp_code` is required. See the [updated example](https://github.com/tchellomello/python-ring-doorbell/blob/261eaf96875e51fc266a5dbfc6198f8cbb8006e0/test.py).

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/python-ring-doorbell/python-ring-doorbell/compare/0.2.9...0.4.0)

**Major breaking change:**

This release is a major breaking change to clean up the auth and follow proper OAuth2. Big thanks to @steve-gombos for this.

All authentication is now done inside `Auth`. The first time you need username, password and optionally an 2-factor auth callback function. After that you have a token and that can be used.

The old cache file is no longer in use and can be removed.

Example usage in `test.py`.

- Auth and ring class refactor [\#175](https://github.com/python-ring-doorbell/python-ring-doorbell/pull/175) (@steve-gombos)
